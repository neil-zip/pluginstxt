# pluginstxt
A proposed standard to decentralize hosting of WordPress plugins and offer an alternative to centralized plugin repositories.

### Summary
“Developers and website owners rely heavily on WordPress plugins to enhance functionality. Currently, the central repository at WordPress.org holds a dominant position in plugin distribution. `plugins.txt` aims to decentralize plugin hosting by allowing developers to self-host and provide necessary metadata for discovery, verification, and secure communication.”

### Example use case:
- A developer releases a plugin update and self-hosts it with all relevant details in a `plugins.txt` file.
- Users and decentralized platforms can access this file to find the latest updates, documentation, and security practices without relying on a centralized repository.

### Instructions for Implementation

#### Step 1: Create the `plugins.txt` file
The `plugins.txt` file should be placed under the `.well-known` directory of your website or plugin host, or/and in the root directory for maximum accessibility.

#### Example File Structure


Great idea! Adding a **short description** and a **meta-data** field (as a JSON string for future extensibility) will make the file more informative while still being concise. Here's the updated structure with these new fields included.

## plugins.txt
A proposed decentralized standard for listing multiple WordPress plugins, including essential information like version, repository, updates, a short description, and optional meta-data.

  The name of the plugin.

- **Version** (Required)  
  The current version of the plugin. Update this field with each new release.

- **Description** (Required)  
  A short description (one sentence) summarizing the main function or feature of the plugin.

- **Repository** (Required)  
  A direct URL to the downloadable plugin file (e.g., a .zip file or hosted repository like GitHub). This should always link to the latest stable version.

- **Updates** (Required)  
  A URL where users can check for updates, release notes, or changelogs for the plugin. This could be a blog category, RSS feed, or dedicated update page.

- **Author** (Required)  
  The name of the person or organization responsible for maintaining the plugin.

- **Contact** (Required)  
  An email or contact form link for users to reach out for support or questions. Use `mailto:` for email addresses or `https://` for contact forms.

- **Meta-Data** (Optional)  
  A JSON-encoded string to include any additional optional information (e.g., WordPress compatibility, license, additional tags, etc.). This field is designed for future flexibility.


### Step 2: Hosting Your Plugins Decentralized
- Once your `plugins.txt` file is ready, self-host it on your website or plugin server.
- Make sure the repository link is accessible, and periodically update the file as needed.
- Optionally, digitally sign the file using OpenPGP or other cryptographic methods to ensure its authenticity.
